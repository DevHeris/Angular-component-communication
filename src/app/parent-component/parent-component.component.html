<!-- Exercise: Task Manager with Parent-Child Communication
Objective:
Create a simple task manager app where the parent component adds tasks and the child component displays them. The child component can also notify the parent when a task is marked as completed.

Requirements:
ParentComponent:

Contains a form to add a new task (with fields for task name and description).
Each task should have a status (pending by default).
The tasks are passed down to the child component to display in a list.
Handles a custom event emitted by the child component when a task is marked as completed.
ChildComponent:

Receives a list of tasks from the parent component using @Input().
Displays the task name, description, and status (either "pending" or "completed").
Contains a button for each task that, when clicked, marks it as completed and notifies the parent using @Output().
Key Tasks:
ParentComponent:

Create a form to add a task (task name and description).
Maintain a list of tasks with their statuses.
Pass the list of tasks to the child component using @Input().
Handle the custom event from the child when a task is marked as completed.
ChildComponent:

Receive the list of tasks from the parent using @Input().
Display each task with its status and a button to mark the task as completed.
Emit an event back to the parent using @Output() when the task is marked as completed.
Example Scenario:
The parent component has a form to create tasks.
Once a task is added, it's displayed by the child component with a "Complete" button.
When the "Complete" button is clicked, the child component notifies the parent, and the status of the task is updated.
Expected Result:
You should be able to:

Pass a list of tasks from the parent to the child.
Display tasks in the child component and mark them as complete.
Notify the parent when a task is marked as completed, and the parent should update the task's status.
